## Singleton

Singleton is known as a creational design pattern used on object creation. It's used to ensure that a class has only one instance of itself. Some characteristics of Singleton are:

- Private constructor to avoid object instanciation;
- It helds an instance of itself;
- It provides an access point to that instance.
